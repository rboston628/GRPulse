## Overview
`GRPulse` is a Newtonian and relativistic asteroseismology code for simple models of white dwarf stars.  It is capable of creating the simple models natively, then calculating the normal modes of pulsation in linear theory.  Support is also available for stars calculated with the [`MESA` stellar evolution code](http://mesa.sourceforge.net).   Released under GNU General Public License, and in compliance with open science principles.

## Documentation
There is extensive [documentation](https://github.com/rboston628/GRPulse/blob/master/documentation/documentation.pdf), explaining in great detail the numerical methods and calculation of the physical properties for each model.

## Citation
This code was written as part of my dissertation research, and several papers are planned.  
The first paper, explaining this version of the code, is to be submitted to *Astrophysics Journal*.

If you use this code for your research before official publication, cite tentatively as:
