# this sample output is to compare our GR Cowling frequencies
# to those tabulated by Lindblom & Splinter (1990), ApJ 348, 198-202
# Their Table 1, column w_{MVS}/w_k can be compared to this output
# to make the comparison (see their footnote c),
# their frequency must be multiplied by (k+1)*sqrt(3/4)

# mass and radius are from their paper, just after their Eqn. 25
